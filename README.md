ðŸš€ Exciting News! Introducing My Latest Project: iPhone Sales Analysis ðŸ“Š

Hello everyone! I hope you're all doing great.

Iâ€™m thrilled to share my latest projectâ€”iPhone Sales Analysisâ€”crafted using Python with Pandas and Plotly libraries. This analysis dives deep into sales trends and provides key insights into the Top 10 iPhones based on:

ðŸ“ˆ Highest-Rated iPhones

ðŸ›’ Number of Reviews on Flipkart

ðŸ’° Relationship Between Sales Price and Ratings

ðŸŽ¯ Impact of Discounts on Ratings

To visualize the findings, I incorporated:

Bar Charts to highlight the Highest-Rated iPhones and Most Reviewed iPhones on Flipkart.
Scatter Plots to explore the relationship between price, discounts, and ratings.

The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and underwent a meticulous process of cleaning, organizing, and transforming to deliver actionable insights.

ðŸ“Š Why this project?

Analyzing sales trends is critical for marketing strategies, and this model is designed to help businesses make data-driven decisions effectively.
